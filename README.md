#### Mouse Clicker
Mouse Clicker is an auto clicker for your mouse. It gives you the choice of which mouse button it clicks, including extra buttons your mouse may have, and also offers adjustable delay between clicks from 0 to 5 seconds. It is most commonly used when players want to go AFK (Away From Keyboard) without being logged out due to being idle.
#### Keyboard Clicker
Keyboard Clicker is another type of auto clicker for your keyboard. Like Mouse Clicker, it also gives you the choice of which keyboard key it presses, including function keys like shift, alt, and Ctrl, as well as key combinations. Keyboard Clicker also offers adjustable delay between presses.
#### Quick Clicker
Quicker Clicker is a triggerable clicker via a keyboard key (update pending) or a mouse button that can be used to turn one click of a button in to multiple clicks. It offers the choice of what key/mouse button is used to trigger the multiple clicks and also give you the options to adjust the delay between clicks and adjust the amount of clicks clicked. It is most commonly used during PvP (Player vs Player) to make their attack clicks faster.
